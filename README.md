Core signal located. Integrity checks failing... errors are intentional.

**Objective:** Establish the final connection.

**Instructions:**

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Locate the `reveal.py` script.
3.  Execute the script (`python reveal.py`).
4.  Observe the errors â€“ they are part of the protocol.
5.  Debug the `reveal.py` sequence, correcting the faults.
6.  Run the corrected script successfully to recompile the signal and reveal the target coordinate.

*Persistence reveals the path.*
